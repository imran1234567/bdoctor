                            <p>After studying multiple entrepreneur driven companies, we have created the unique model of
                                Business Doctors. A dispassionate Doctor, who could work with an entrepreneur to diagnose
                                areas of intervention and put the company on the right growth path
                            </p>
                            <p>All companies go through a typical business cycle that is a result of various internal and external,
                                macro and micro factors that impact the business and its related ecosystem.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Companies that do not meet market performance lack certain factors that are essential
                                    for growth. These may be:</strong>
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Appropriate Team</li>
                                <li>Balance Sheet Strength</li>
                                <li>Revenue Model</li>
                                <li>Product Innovation</li>
                                <li>Product Diversification</li>
                                <li>Pricing Strategy</li>
                                <li>Technology</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>While most business consultancy firms simply put together a companyâ€™s business strategy,
                                we walk the talk and help companies implement every facet of the suggested strategic plan.
