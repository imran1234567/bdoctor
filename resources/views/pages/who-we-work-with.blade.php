                                <h5>Promoter Driven Companies</h5>

                                <p>We work with established promoter driven companies that need a fresh thought process with regards to product, technology, marketing and branding. We also work towards improving the financial positioning of the company by financial restructuring, help infuse necessary funding and bridge in gaps in management and operational teams. Our endeavor is to help such companies adapt to changing times and scale new heights.</p>

                                <h5>Private Equity / Venture Capital Backed Companies</h5>

                                <p>PE/VC funds are saddled with low/non performing investments as a part of their portfolio due to&nbsp;reasons such as lack of team bandwidth, need for external intervention, stuck due to fund closures with pending exits, excessive investor intervention, inability to move along with time and unsuccessful fundraising. We partner with funds and help them turnaround such portfolio companies.</p>

                                <p>Present mechanism for handling distressed assets is focused on debt restructuring. However, just deferral of debt obligations may not always suffice. In many cases, it ought to be coupled with operational restructuring. We partner with ARCs to help them turnaround such assets in their portfolio. It could be just financial restructuring or overall business restructuring.</p>
